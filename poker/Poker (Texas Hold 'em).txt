Poker (Texas Hold 'em)


Determine the winner given each player's set of cards per the following (which is just a description of the rules of poker)



In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:

High Card: Highest value card.
One Pair: Two cards of the same value.
Two Pairs: Two different pairs.
Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.
Straight: All cards are consecutive values.
Flush: All cards of the same suit.
Full House: Three of a kind and a pair.
Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.
Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.


The cards are valued in the order:

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10(T), Jack(J), Queen(Q), King(K), Ace(A).



The cards are suited, suit doesn't beat suit:

Spade(S), Heart(H), Diamond(D), Club(C).



If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives:



But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared; if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.



Solution function structure:

/**

* @param {string[]} hand1

* @param {string[]} hand2

* @return {int = winner

*/



The function will accept two inputs: hand1 and hand2 type string array, that is, the hand of player 1 and the hand of player 2.

It must return 1 (means Player 1 wins) or 2 (means Player 2 wins).



Sample Input:



2S 4D 2C TC KS AS QH TH 9S KH



so:



hand1 = ['2S', '4D', '2C', 'TC', 'KS']

hand2 = ['AS', 'QH', 'TH', '9S', 'KH']



Output:



Player 1 wins
