Alphabet Reconstruction


You have found a list of alien words. You know for a fact that words in this list are sorted, but you don't know what the alphabet is.

You would like to reconstruct the original alphabet in such a way, that the ordering between letters would explain the sorting of the list.

For example, let's say our list is the following:

ccda
ccbk
cd
a
ab
From here one might infer that in this alphabet, "c" precedes "d" and "a", and "d" precedes "b". Here is a possible alphabet that satisfies these restrictions: cakdb



Input Sample:



ccda

ccb

cd

a

ab

d



Output Sample:



cadb
